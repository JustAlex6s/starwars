                It is a period of civil war.
                Rebel spaceships, striking
                from a hidden base, have won
                their first victory against
                the evil Galactic Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the battle, Rebel
                spies managed to steal secret
                plans to the Empire's
                ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                STAR, an armored space
                station with enough power to
                destroy an entire planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pursued by the Empire's
                sinister agents, Princess
                Leia races home aboard her
                starship, custodian of the
                stolen plan that can save
                her people and restore
                freedom to the galaxy....
